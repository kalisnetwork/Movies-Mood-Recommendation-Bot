# Movies-Mood-Recommendation-Bot
Created an AI-powered Movies Mood Recommendation Bot using Python and web scraping techniques. The bot allows users to input their current mood, such as "happy," "sad," "fear," "anger," "surprise," or "disgust." Leveraging IMDb genres, the bot intelligently suggests movie genres that match the user's mood or aims to uplift it.
